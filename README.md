# Harkins Odyssey IMAX 70mm Seat Monitor — six-ticket rule

This cloud Playwright monitor checks **The Odyssey (IMAX 70mm)** at Harkins Arizona Mills 18 while your Mac is off. It reads Harkins’ verified live availability data when exposed; otherwise it verifies the actual rendered seat icons. It fails closed when availability is ambiguous and never selects, holds, reserves, or purchases seats.

## Current alert rule

An alert is created only when one showtime satisfies **all** of these conditions:

- showtime is strictly **after 2:00 PM** and no later than **11:00 PM**;
- exactly **6 tickets** can be chosen using one of these arrangements:
  - **6 together**;
  - **4 together + 2 together**;
  - **3 together + 3 together**;
  - **2 together + 2 together + 2 together**;
- every block contains at least **2 physically adjacent, consecutively numbered seats**;
- every selected seat is in rows **G through M**;
- every selected block is entirely inside the row’s **middle 50%**;
- wheelchair and accessible-companion seats are excluded.

A longer available run may be used. For example, a run of 7 seats can supply the required 6, and a run of 5 plus a pair can supply 4+2. Isolated single seats never count.

## Alerts

The workflow creates a private GitHub issue only when the rule is met. It assigns and mentions `@KIRAN-REDDY`, allowing GitHub to email the verified address selected in the account’s notification settings.

No Gmail password, SMTP credential, Telegram token, or custom repository secret is required.

## Schedule

- Today through day 6: every 10 minutes.
- Days 7 through 44: once per hour.
- Manual runs default to 7 days.

## Update the existing repository

Replace the repository files with this package, commit, and push. The state format is version 4, so alerts saved under earlier rule engines will not suppress a valid six-ticket alert.

## Validation

The unit tests cover:

- 6;
- 4+2;
- 3+3;
- 2+2+2;
- longer runs used as subsets;
- rejection of fewer than six usable seats;
- rejection of isolated single seats;
- middle-50% filtering;
- the after-2:00-PM through 11:00-PM time window;
- unavailable and ambiguous rendered-seat icons.

Run locally with:

```bash
npm test
```

Run a one-day GitHub test without sending a setup notification:

```bash
gh workflow run monitor.yml \
  -R KIRAN-REDDY/harkins-odyssey-monitor \
  -f start_offset_days=0 \
  -f scan_days=1 \
  -f send_test_notification=false
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `ROWS` | `G,H,I,J,K,L,M` | Allowed rows |
| `TOTAL_TICKETS` | `6` | Total tickets required in one showtime |
| `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE` | `2` | Minimum adjacent seats in every block |
| `MIDDLE_PERCENT` | `50` | Allowed central portion of each row |
| `AFTER_MINUTES` | `840` | Showtime must be strictly later than 2:00 PM |
| `LAST_SHOW_MINUTES` | `1380` | Latest accepted showtime is 11:00 PM |
| `EXCLUDE_ACCESSIBLE` | `true` | Exclude wheelchair and companion seats |
| `SESSION_CONCURRENCY` | `3` | Parallel session pages |
| `ALERT_GITHUB_USER` | `KIRAN-REDDY` | Account assigned and mentioned |

## Diagnostics

When verification fails, the workflow uploads screenshots, HTML, and JSON metadata under the run’s **Artifacts** section. Missing data, CAPTCHAs, blocks, unknown icons, or markup changes produce no ticket alert.

## Temporary release schedule (Phoenix time)

- Wednesday, July 29, 2026: every 10 minutes, scanning August 21 through September 11.
- Thursday, July 30 through Friday, September 11, 2026: every 4 hours, scanning a rolling 45-day window.
- At 12:05 AM Phoenix time on September 12, a lightweight retirement job disables `monitor.yml` automatically. The monitoring job also refuses to run after September 11, 2026. No manual shutdown is required.


## Automatic retirement

The workflow has a hard expiration date of **September 11, 2026**. At **12:05 AM Phoenix time on September 12**, a final lightweight job calls GitHub's workflow-disable API using the repository's temporary `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It does not install Node, Playwright, or Chrome during that retirement run.

The gate job also checks the Phoenix calendar date before every invocation. Any manual or delayed invocation after September 11 skips all seat-monitoring work and disables the workflow instead. The workflow requests `actions: write` solely for this self-disable operation.
